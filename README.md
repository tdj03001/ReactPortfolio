# Dev Portfolio
  

## Purpose

This page is intended to provide a look at my developer profile. As a student at UPenn LPS's Coding Bootcamp 2019-2020, I will be adding progressively complex projects to this portfolio as I learn more about software development. 

Thanks for visiting! Please feel free to reach out using any of the contact methods on my site.
